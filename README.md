# AI Software Engineering Assistant

## Overview

AI Software Engineering Assistant is a distributed multi-agent AI platform designed to help developers automate software engineering workflows.

The project focuses on:
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- multi-agent orchestration
- structured tool calling
- MCP integrations
- workflow systems
- distributed AI architecture

The system intentionally uses a hybrid architecture:
- NestJS as the primary backend platform,
- Python as the AI orchestration service.

This mirrors real-world AI system architecture where:
- Node.js/Java/Go services manage platform/backend concerns,
- Python services handle AI/ML orchestration.

---

# Goals

The project is designed to teach:
- LangChain abstractions,
- LangGraph workflows,
- agent orchestration,
- distributed AI systems,
- structured tool calling,
- MCP integrations,
- AI workflow engineering,
- service-to-service communication.

---

# Architecture Philosophy

# Why Hybrid Architecture?

The project intentionally separates:
- platform/backend concerns,
- AI orchestration concerns.

---

# NestJS Responsibilities

NestJS handles:
- APIs,
- workflow management,
- persistence,
- websocket streaming,
- orchestration requests,
- backend architecture.

Python handles:
- LangGraph workflows,
- agents,
- AI orchestration,
- retrieval,
- tool execution.

---

# Why This Architecture Matters

This teaches:
- distributed systems,
- service communication,
- AI microservices,
- orchestration boundaries,
- scalable architecture.

This is significantly more valuable than building a single Python monolith.

# Development Phases

# Phase 1 — Core Chat System

## Goals
- React chat UI,
- NestJS backend,
- FastAPI AI service,
- streaming responses.

---

# Phase 1 Implementation

This repository now includes the first runnable slice of the hybrid system:

- `frontend/` — React + TypeScript + Vite chat workspace.
- `backend/` — NestJS API gateway with in-memory conversation management.
- `ai-service/` — FastAPI service with streaming workflow endpoints.

## Streaming Flow

```txt
React EventSource
      ↓
NestJS /chat/conversations/:id/stream
      ↓
FastAPI /ai/execute-workflow/stream
      ↓
token events streamed back to the UI
```

## Local Setup

Install Node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install Python dependencies into the local service dependency folder:

```bash
python3.13 -m pip install --target ai-service/.deps -r ai-service/requirements.txt
```

Run all three services:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Service URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- NestJS backend: `http://localhost:3000`
- FastAPI AI service: `http://localhost:8000`

Useful verification commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run lint
PYTHONPATH=ai-service python3.13 -m py_compile ai-service/app/main.py ai-service/app/api/workflow.py ai-service/app/services/core_chat.py
```

The Phase 1 AI service returns a deterministic streamed response. This preserves the frontend/backend streaming contract while leaving the implementation ready for LangChain and LangGraph integration in later phases.

---

# Phase 2 — LangChain Integration

## Goals
- prompts,
- LCEL,
- structured outputs,
- parsers.

---

# Phase 2 Implementation

The AI service now routes core chat requests through LangChain primitives while keeping the Phase 1 streaming contract intact.

- Prompt template: `ai-service/app/prompts/core_chat.py`
- LCEL chain: `ai-service/app/chains/core_chat.py`
- Structured schema: `ai-service/app/schemas/engineering_response.py`
- JSON parser: `ai-service/app/parsers/engineering_response.py`

The current chain uses Gemini when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set. When the key is blank, it falls back to a deterministic local model simulator. This makes the app runnable without API keys, while still exercising the same LangChain contracts that Gemini uses:

```txt
ChatPromptTemplate
      ↓
Gemini model or local RunnableLambda adapter
      ↓
JsonOutputParser(Pydantic schema)
      ↓
Markdown response formatter
      ↓
SSE token stream
```

`POST /ai/execute-workflow` now returns both `result` markdown and `structuredOutput` JSON. `POST /ai/execute-workflow/stream` continues to stream markdown tokens through NestJS to the React UI.

---

# Phase 3 — LangGraph Workflows

## Goals
- graph execution,
- planner agent,
- writer agent,
- workflow state management.

---

# Phase 3 Implementation

The AI service now wraps the Phase 2 LCEL chain in a minimal LangGraph workflow:

```txt
START
  ↓
planner
  ↓
writer
  ↓
END
```

- Graph implementation: `ai-service/app/workflows/core_chat.py`
- `planner` invokes the existing LangChain/LCEL chain and captures provider/configuration errors.
- `writer` formats the structured response into markdown for the existing SSE chat stream.
- `POST /ai/execute-workflow` includes `structuredOutput.workflowRun` with graph name, status, node events, and error type when applicable.

Success criteria for Phase 3:

- The workflow runs through LangGraph, not a direct chain call.
- `structuredOutput.workflowRun.events` shows `start`, `planner`, and `writer` state transitions.
- The existing React → NestJS → FastAPI SSE stream still emits markdown and `done`.
- With a bad Gemini key/model, the graph returns `status: failed` and a visible configuration response instead of disconnecting.

Tradeoff: this is intentionally a two-node graph shell, not full multi-agent orchestration. It makes LangGraph testable now without introducing speculative agent/tool behavior before Phase 4 and Phase 5.

# Phase 4 — Tool Calling & LangGraph Orchestration

This phase transformed the project from:

into:
